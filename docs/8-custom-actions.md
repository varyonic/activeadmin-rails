# Custom Controller Actions

Add custom actions the Rails Way:

## Collection Actions

A collection action is a controller action which operates on the collection of
resources. Add both the action to the controller as well as a route.

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def import_csv
    # Do some CSV importing work here...
    redirect_to collection_path, notice: "CSV imported successfully!"
  end
end
```
and

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  post '/admin/posts/import_csv', controller: 'admin/posts', action: 'import_csv'
  ...
```

This collection action will generate a route at `/admin/posts/import_csv`
pointing to the `Admin::PostsController#import_csv` controller action.

## Member Actions

A member action is a controller action which operates on a single resource.

For example, to add a lock action to a user resource, you would do the
following:

```ruby
class Admin::UsersController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def lock
    resource.lock!
    redirect_to resource_path, notice: "Locked!"
  end
```
and
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  put '/admin/users/:id/lock', controller: 'admin/users', action: 'lock'
  ...
```

## HTTP Verbs

Sometimes you want to create an action that handles multiple
HTTP verbs. In that case, this is the suggested approach:

```ruby
def foo
  if request.post?
    resource.update_attributes! foo: params[:foo] || {}
    head :ok
  else
    render :foo
  end
end
```
and
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'admin/users/:id/foo', container: 'admin/users', action: 'foo'
  post 'admin/users/:id/foo', container: 'admin/users', action: 'foo'
  ...
```

## Rendering

Custom controller actions support rendering within the standard Active Admin
layout.

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  # /admin/posts/:id/comments
  def comments
    @comments = resource.comments
    # This will render app/views/admin/posts/comments.html.erb
  end
end
```

If you would like to use the same view syntax as the rest of Active Admin, you
can use the Arbre file extension: .arb.

For example, create `app/views/admin/posts/comments.html.arb` with:

```ruby
table_for assigns[:post].comments do
  column :id
  column :author
  column :body do |comment|
    simple_format comment.body
  end
end
```

## Page Titles

The page title for the custom action will be the translated version of
the controller action name. For example, a member_action named "upload_csv" will
look up a translation key of `active_admin.upload_csv`. If none are found, it
defaults to the name of the controller action.

If this doesn't work for you, you can always set the `@page_title` instance
variable in your controller action to customize the page title.

```ruby
class Admin::PostsController < ActiveAdmin::ResourceController
  def comments
    @comments   = resource.comments
    @page_title = "#{resource.title}: Comments" # Sets the page title
  end
end
```
Alternately use `content_for(:page_title)` in the view template.

# Action Items

To include your own action items (like the New, Edit and Delete buttons), add an
`action_item` block. The first parameter is just a name to identify the action,
and is required. For example, to add a "View on site" button to view a blog
post:

```ruby
action_item :view, only: :show do
  link_to 'View on site', post_path(post) if post.published?
end
```

Actions items also accept the `:if` option to conditionally display them:

```ruby
action_item :super_action,
            only: :show,
            if: proc{ current_admin_user.super_admin? } do
  "Only display this to super admins on the show screen"
end
```

By default action items are positioned in the same order as they defined (after default actions), 
but itâ€™s also possible to specify their position manually:

```ruby
action_item :help, priority: 0 do
  "Display this action to the first position"
end
```

Default action item priority is 10.

# Modifying the Controller

Using the `controller` method within the registration block is deprecated, create and modify the controller explicitly.
